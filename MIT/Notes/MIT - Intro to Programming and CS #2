# Overview
**I/O, Assignment, Conditionals and Loop Constructs (A set of primitives to program everything**
1. Decomposition: breaking code into modules
2. Abstraction: a contract that is referred by a name and supress its operation details
I. [Functions]]: manufacturing patterns of computation into new primitives by breaking code into modules and supressing its details;
- def name(x):
- x is the placeholder
- if statements
- loop constructs
- return procedures
a) Invoking a function by passing values in the parameters; b) binds x to 16, locally, inside the confines of the environment of the procedure
- local bindings don't affect global bindings, so there are multiple scopes, environments
# Problem 1: Enumerate and Check
- brute-force algorithm
- range: collection of integers from 0 up to 1 - the last value
